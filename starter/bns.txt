1. What would the calculations tell you about the fairness of "Naive Bayes"
Overall there is a fairness level to naive bayes as it is a decent predictor and
uses good structure of statistical data to provide its information and with the given
examples I would consider it fair to a degree, probabily better with more input data as
more to "learn" from but can be very limiited with limited data, so as an overall concept
it can seem as fair as could be made, but again is not 100 precent


2. What is the most significant thing you have learned from the Bayesian Network module, overall?
I learned about the relationship between factors and variables and how to properly be able to calculate different
aspects such as normalization, sum out, how restricting factors affect it, etc. It was useful to see
these aspects structured in a different format such as coded to be able to see how these structures work.
as well as how probabilites work in a bayes network.

3. if the self-assessment exercises have been of any value?
Yes I do believe the self-assessment have value especially if it is assessed by completion because it allows
the person to turly think about their answer and not have to work about correctness or proper writing, etc...
Its also good because throughout the assignment youre thinking about what you might be able to reflect on
at the end, and remember the moments you overcame/struggled with.
